# escalatorModeling
A first project made in AnyLogic. 

It is a program that models pedestrians' behaviour at some metro escalator.

It was created to measeure the effectiveness of people standing on both sides of an escalator rather than standing at one side and walking upstairs at the other side. 

To see the results  and some highlights check the PDF report.
